AeB contains the following:

1) Web Package: Extensive support for page design.

2) Exerquiz Package: Support for creating online interactive exercises and
   quizzes.

3) eforms Package: Extensive support for Acrobat forms and links

4) dljslib package: A package of JavaScript functions that extends the
    capability of exerquiz.

5) taborder package: Supports the create of a tab order for form fields.

6) Documentation for AeB (AcroTeX eDucatation Bundle) and eForms
    (including insdljs and dljslib).

I maintain a web site featuring TeX/LaTeX/PDF stuff called
AcroTeX (www.math.uakron.edu/~dpstory/acrotex.html).  There you
will find the home web page of the AcroTeX eDucation Bundle.
(www.math.uakron.edu/~dpstory/webeq.html).

Examples for AeB have been moved to
http://www.math.uakron.edu/~dpstory/webeq_ex.html, another copy
of the examples are at

Additional examples are posted on the AcroTeX Blog page

Now, I simply must get back to my retirement.
