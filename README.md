# Santa-Ana-Sucker-Recovery

This repository is for the first project in EA30, 2016. We will use this repository to track the project and the development of the public products.

## Project Proposal

Please use the Project Proposal as a resource to track how we are approaching the project. The proposal is a living document, so we will make updates to the document regularly. 

## Data Storage

Flat files, which are relatively small, will be stored on the site. Larger files, such as images and movies will be stored on another site (TBD). 


## Repository Management

Please contact marclos if you would like collaborator access to the site.
